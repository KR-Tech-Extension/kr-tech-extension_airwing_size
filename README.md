# KR Tech Extension: Squadron Size Air Wings

### Last Updated for Apr 27, 2024. (KR's 1.1 release)

This is the official submod for [KR Tech Extension](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3105210203) that reduces the average airwing size down from 100 to 24 (12 for strategic bombers, 50 for transport planes & guided missiles - carrier airwings size remained the same but are 24 on land), based on Jax's [Squadron Size Air Wings](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2872975666) series of HoI4 mod.

As air groups are now a thing, this shouldn't affects the gameplay too negatively for those who didn't want to micromanage airforces too often.
